# Digital-Clock-VHDL
Digital Clock [MM/SS] on Seven Seg Display implemented in VHDL
-

The aim of the project was to design a Digital Clock on a Seven Segment Display. The seven segment display is divided into minutes and seconds [MM/SS]. Furthermore it allows for the setting of time via set switches - the first bit switch on the FPGA sets the time, with the consective 4 bit switches allowing the time to be set in specific intervals. 

This project was done more than a couple of years back while learning VHDL using Xilinx FPGA with Xilinx ISE. This repo might contain extranous or IDE generated files so sorry about that. The video for the same can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ae73T3BLVV8. Any improvements to the code/implementation is welcome.
